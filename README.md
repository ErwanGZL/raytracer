# MUST
> Your raytracer must support the following features:

Primitives:
- [ ] Plane

Transformations:
- [ ] Translation

Light:
- [ ] Directional light
- [ ] Ambient light

Material:
- [ ] Flat color

- [ ] Scene configuration:
- [ ] Add primitives to scene
- [ ] Set up lighting
- [ ] Set up camera

Interface:
- [ ] No GUI, output to a PPM file

# SHOULD
> Once the previous features are working properly, you should add the following ones:

Primitives:
- [ ] Cylinder
- [ ] Cone

Transformation:
- [ ] Rotation

Light:
- [ ] Drop shadows

- [ ] Texturing from file (1)
- [ ] Texturing from procedural generation of chessboard (1)
- [ ] Texturing from procedural generation of Perlin noise (1)
- [ ] Normal mapping (2)

Scene configuration:
- [ ] Import a scene in a scene (2)
- [ ] Set up antialiasing through supersampling (0.5)
- [ ] Set up antialiasing through adaptative supersampling (1)

Optimizations:
- [ ] Space partitionning (2)
- [ ] Multithreading (1)
- [ ] Clustering (3)

Interface:

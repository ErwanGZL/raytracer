# MUST
> Your raytracer must support the following features:

Primitives:
- [x] Plane

Transformations:
- [x] Translation

Light:
- [x] Directional light
- [x] Ambient light

Material:
- [x] Flat color

Scene configuration:
- [x] Add primitives to scene
- [x] Set up lighting
- [x] Set up camera

Interface:
- [x] No GUI, output to a PPM file

# SHOULD
> Once the previous features are working properly, you should add the following ones:

Primitives:
- [x] Cylinder
- [x] Cone

Transformation:
- [ ] Rotation

Light:
- [x] Drop shadows
